Basis
=====

This module provides a simple way to create a basis for a vector space.
The :class:`BaseBasis` class is the base class for all bases.
It provides a way to apply a set of coefficeints to a basis, access to individual basis functions, and a way to compute a Jacobian matrix combining the basis functions with a forward measurement model.
